            <p class="prompt">
                Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g.,
                "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                A core problem within this space has to do with rewarding new habits. 
                There is no current mainstream solution to creating competition behind habit forming.
                We want to combine the competitiveness you get from group rankings with habits. 
                Apps such as Strava, and Nike's running app are the closest thing to this, where 
                friends can see and like other friends runs. We aim to generalize this to all 
                types of activities users wish to make habit forming, and add a competitive backbone to it.

            <p class="prompt">
                Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem
                (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has
                already been tried?")

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <!-- 1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?
            2. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data form an
            external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
            3. What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interaction are you expecting
            to provide? Note that your app will need to support two different interactive features;
            be sure to explain what both of them are!
            4. How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a
            solution to the problem you described? -->

            <h3>Problem/Data Domain</h3>

            <p class="prompt">
                The overall topic of our project is about habit tracking and building. 
                According to the book “Atomic Habits” by James Clear, there are four steps that compose a habit. 
                Habits are often easily broken due to the lack of an effective tracking system, so we want to 
                build a technological solution that can serve as a workspace for successfully building those habits 
                and even have an internal reward system everytime one successfully completes a habit.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                A core problem within this space has to do with rewarding new habits. 
                There is no current mainstream solution to creating competition behind habit forming.
                We want to combine the competitiveness you get from group rankings with habits. 
                Apps such as Strava, and Nike's running app are the closest thing to this, where 
                friends can see and like other friends runs. We aim to generalize this to all 
                types of activities users wish to make habit forming, and add a competitive backbone to it. 

            </p>

            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem
                (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has
                already been tried?")
            </p>
            <p>
                James Clear has a <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">website</a> where
                readers can find links or methods to access resources for habit improvement that build
                upon the concepts in <em>Atomic Habits</em>. The most notable resource available is a
                cheatsheet, a very quick summary of <em>Atomic Habits</em>, but you need to show proof
                of purchase by sending a recepit for the book to 1book@atomichabits.com. Although the
                cheat sheet is useful for a quick reference to concepts explained in the book,
                it does not provide an easy way for tracking your success or failure in implementing
                new habits.

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            

            <p class='prompt'>
                Our users consist of everyday people who are struggling to keep 
                with a new habit. Users will be viewing their own personal habits that
                they wish to achieve each day, as well as how others in their circle are 
                doing on keeping up with theirs. We will not be pulling data from additional 
                sources, as our users will populate their own pages. We may link additional 
                resources users can use if they want to read up on habit forming. 
 
                The two interactive features of our site will be each users personal page containing
                the habits they are trying to track, this will be listed in a calender view 
                that they may add and remove from. The second feature will involve individuals
                being able to compete with one another on certain habits. This app will help
                solve our problem by adding a social media/competitive factor behind habits,
                hopefully giving users that extra bit of <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/what-does-it-really-take-to-build-a-new-habit">motivation</a> they need to achieve them.

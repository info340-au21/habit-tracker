            <p class="prompt">
                The overall topic of our project is about habit tracking and building. 
                According to the book “Atomic Habits” by James Clear, there are four steps that compose a habit. 
                Habits are often easily broken due to the lack of an effective tracking system, so we want to 
                build a technological solution that can serve as a workspace for successfully building those habits 
                and even have an internal reward system everytime one successfully completes a habit.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                A core problem within this space has to do with rewarding new habits. 
                There is no current mainstream solution to creating competition behind habit forming.
                We want to combine the competitiveness you get from group rankings with habits. 
                Apps such as Strava, and Nike's running app are the closest thing to this, where 
                friends can see and like other friends runs. We aim to generalize this to all 
                types of activities users wish to make habit forming, and add a competitive backbone to it.

            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem
                (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has
                already been tried?")
            </p>

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            

            <p class='prompt'>
                Our users consist of everyday people who are struggling to keep 
                with a new habit. Users will be viewing their own personal habits that
                they wish to achieve each day, as well as how others in their circle are 
                doing on keeping up with theirs.

            <p class="prompt">
                Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g.,
                "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g.,
                "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?").
            </p>
            <p>
                
            </p>

            <p class="prompt">
                Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem
                (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has
                already been tried?")

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <!-- 1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?
            2. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data form an
            external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
            3. What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interaction are you expecting
            to provide? Note that your app will need to support two different interactive features;
            be sure to explain what both of them are!
            4. How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a
            solution to the problem you described? -->
